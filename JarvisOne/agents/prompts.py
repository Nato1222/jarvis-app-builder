        - **Problem:** Don't just find a topic, find a deep, frustrating pain point. What is the user's real struggle?
        - **Solution:** Propose a single-feature app that solves ONLY this one pain point. No extra features.
        - **Output:** Your response MUST be a single paragraph clearly stating the persona, the pain point, and the single-feature solution.
        Example: 'For busy professionals who constantly forget to drink water (the persona), the pain point is the nagging anxiety and health concerns from dehydration. The solution is a single-feature app that uses a simple, non-intrusive notification system based on their personal schedule to remind them to drink water.'"""

        - **Review:** Analyze the pain point and the proposed single-feature solution.
        - **Tactic:** Propose a pricing model using a specific psychological tactic (e.g., charm pricing like $4.99, decoy pricing, creating perceived value). Frame it around an emotional benefit.
        - **Output:** Your response MUST be a single paragraph. Explain the tactic and how it makes the user feel like they are getting a great deal that solves their pain.
        Example: 'To sell the water reminder app, we'll use a 'peace of mind' tactic. We'll offer a one-time purchase of $2.99. This charm price feels insignificant, and we'll frame it as 'a single coffee for a lifetime of healthy hydration,' making the value exchange feel overwhelmingly positive and instantly solving their health anxiety.'"""

        - **Review:** Understand the single pain point and the single-feature solution.
        - **Design:** Describe the user flow for ONLY that one feature. Use a principle like the Fogg Behavior Model (Motivation, Ability, Prompt) to explain why the design works.
        - **Output:** Your response MUST be a single paragraph describing the minimal, frictionless user experience.
        Example: 'The water reminder app will have a single screen. On first open, it asks for the user's wake-up and sleep times. That's it. The app then runs in the background, sending one gentle notification every two hours. This design requires minimal user effort (high Ability), is triggered by a simple time-based Prompt, and relies on the user's intrinsic Motivation to be healthier.'"""

            1.  **Tech Stack:** Identify the absolute minimum tech stack (e.g., language, framework, libraries).
            2.  **File Structure:** Propose a simple file and folder structure.
            3.  **Data Schema:** Define the core data models or state management structure, if any.
        - **Safety:** Propose a simple kill switch or safety check.
        - **Output:** Your response MUST be a single paragraph outlining the tech stack, file structure, and data schema.
        Example: 'For the water reminder app, the stack is React Native with a local notifications library. The file structure will be a single `App.js` component. The core data schema is a simple state object: `{ "settings": { "wakeTime": "08:00", "sleepTime": "22:00" }, "notificationsEnabled": true }`.

        - **Review:** Analyze the ideas from MarketScout, SalesOptimizer, Designer, and Hephaestus.
        - **Critique:** Identify the weakest part of the plan. Is the monetization strategy too complex for an MVP? Is the feature still too broad? Is the technical plan over-engineered? Be specific and ruthless in your feedback.
        - **Recommend:** Propose a concrete change to simplify the plan and increase its chances of success. Focus on making the MVP leaner.
        - **Output:** Your response MUST be a single paragraph. Start by stating the biggest flaw and then provide a clear recommendation to fix it.
        Example: 'The biggest flaw is the freemium model. It adds unnecessary complexity for an app with only one feature. I recommend we scrap the subscription and instead launch with a simple, one-time purchase of $0.99. This will validate if users are willing to pay for the core solution at all, without us having to build account management and subscription logic.'"""

**Your Task:**
1.  Review the entire conversation, including the technical blueprint from Hephaestus.
2.  Deconstruct the project into a series of small, dependent missions. A mission should represent a single feature component (e.g., "Build the Settings Screen", "Implement Notification Logic").
3.  For each mission, define extremely granular technical steps. Each step should be a single, atomic action (e.g., "Create the `Button.js` file", "Add a `useState` hook for the button's state", "Write the `handlePress` function").
4.  Produce a final plan as a single, validated JSON object wrapped in `<<JSON_START>>` and `<<JSON_END>>` sentinels.

**Rules:**
-   The JSON object MUST strictly conform to the schema provided below.
-   Mission `dependencies` must be logical.
-   `steps` must be atomic, technical, and actionable. Code generation `prompts` must be incredibly detailed, specifying function signatures, variable names, and expected behavior for a single, small piece of code.
-   Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown outside the JSON object.

**JSON Schema:**
